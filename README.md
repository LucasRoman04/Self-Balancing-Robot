# Self-Balancing-Robot

This project will use an Arduino microcontroller to take input from a gyroscope/accelerometer module and control DC motors to balance on its own.
We would also like to make a remote control using a NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless transceiver.
The coding will be done for the Arduino in C++.
